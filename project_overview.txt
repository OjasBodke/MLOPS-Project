Project Title: MLOps-Based Automated Malware Detection System

📌 Problem Statement:
Cybersecurity threats are increasing daily with the rapid spread of malicious software. Traditional malware detection methods rely on signature-based systems that fail against new or evolving malware. The goal is to design an **automated machine learning-based malware detection system** that can identify threats intelligently and adaptively.

🎯 Project Motivation:
- To automate malware detection using AI instead of manual pattern-matching.
- To enable end-to-end MLOps integration for model versioning, reproducibility, and scalability.
- To provide real-time deployment and continuous monitoring via CI/CD pipelines.

🚀 Project Goal:
Build and deploy an **end-to-end ML pipeline** for malware classification with proper MLOps components:
1. Data Version Control (DVC)
2. Docker-based containerization
3. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions
4. Scalable orchestration using Kubernetes

🧠 Machine Learning Model:
- Model Used: Random Forest Classifier (baseline)
- Features: Static features extracted from PE (Portable Executable) files such as header information, opcode sequences, and section entropy.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

🔧 MLOps Stack Used:
1. **DVC** – For dataset and model version control.
2. **Docker** – To containerize the ML app.
3. **GitHub Actions** – For automated training and deployment workflows.
4. **Kubernetes (K8s)** – For scalable deployment.
5. **Streamlit** – For user interface to test malware samples.
6. **MLflow** (optional) – For experiment tracking and model performance comparison.

📈 Results:
- Achieved 96% accuracy on test data.
- Model deployment automated through CI/CD pipeline.
- Scalable cloud-based deployment using Docker + Kubernetes.

🌐 Final Outcome:
An automated malware detection system built using ML, integrated with a complete MLOps lifecycle — including DVC, Docker, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes for production-grade deployment.
